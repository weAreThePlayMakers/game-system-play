Welcome to the new Story creation kit ala djwaglmuffin

I am your host, djwaglmuffin, and it is my honor and privalege to help you through your story-telling journey. I, myself, am an avid story designer and I love writing and drawing and sticking it all into one big thing. I am also a supporter of the comic book communit and strive to get the word out about the thriving artisti under toe.

We are the backbone of the entertainment industry and all others started with sequential art. Before movies, before video games, before animation and TV, there was always sequential are and illustration.

From cave drawings to egypt to Dante's inferno to stan lee to you and I. Sequential art is one of the oldest forms of expression next to dance and music. Comic books give us a unique way to tell a story and call it ours. Next to novels, we are able to captivate an audience, and let them fill in all the banks with their imaginations while riding on the backs of a main character.



If you have any questions about this kit, please feel free to let me know. I was ablet o cover a lot in the kit already, so be sure to read everything and, between you and I, it's a lot of reading.

This kit is not designed to help you draw better but that will get better once you have an organized story and can concentrate better on your art as opposed to thinking about how they're going to handle an action scene. 

I hope you all find it even more useful than the last one. I think the trope sheets will really help people as much as they have helped me.

Here's to comics!
