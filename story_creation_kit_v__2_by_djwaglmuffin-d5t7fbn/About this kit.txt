New kit inculdes:


.jpgs and .psd files

If you do not have photoshop, these pages can be printed out or, if using a digital program, can drawn over or set the blending mode to "multiply" and draw through.



Character Aesthetic sheet with item work:

	Use this page to draw the front and back of your characters, some expressions, any items they carry with them and the descriptions of those items and clothing.

Character description sheet:

	Use this page to write up the general idea and persona of your characters. 

	*Zodiac: I included a place for the zodiac to give you a generalized foundation fo a personality type. Western or eastern astrology can help to give you ideas on how to shape a characters. The PSD file can let you change this slot to whatever you wish.

	When finish, print them out or use the folders I have created for you to use for reference when you need it.

Name/storyboard:

	name (pronounced Na-mae) is the Japanese format for storyboarding. Use this sheet to layout panels and text bubbles. Label your bubbles numercially and have your script numbered to reflect each other.

Synopsis page:

	Use this page to summarize your story and/or chapters. Put these in a separate folder and make sure to keep them labelled and organized. Place any unused ideas in a separate folder just in case you need them later.

Treatment page:

	You can use this page or an open word document to do up detailed bullet points for each chapter. Do not make them longer than 12 pages. PLace them in separeate folders for each chapter and be sure to place any unusued in a separate folder for later.

Trope Map:

	The trope map can be used to give your characters, settings, plots and villains more depth and help to keep a your story understandable and help characters stay in characters.

	*the label "character" in the PSD file can be changed to anything you want to lay out tropes for.

	I reccomend no ore than 8 tropes for each characters. You don't want someone to be completly predicatable and dictated. Somtimes it's a good idea to let your characters live and see what the results are.

Relationship tropes:

	You can use this page to map the tropes between characters and/or groups of characters.

	Feel free to add characters to the list, but for purposes of the kit, I use the two-character set up.

The villain's plan page:

	Use this page to establish the goals of your villains and how their plans affect your main character and their story line.
